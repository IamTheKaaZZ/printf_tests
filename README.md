## Introduction

Welcome to my tester for the ft_printf project for the 42 course.

## How to use:

1. Run `make` to see the magic happen!
2. Before using the tester, you might want to update the path to your `ft_printf.h`\
in `tests/test_main.c` for it to work properly.
3. Make sure your `libftprintf.a` is compiled before using this tester.
4. Very instruction, much wow !

## Helpful utilities

### Upcoming updates!

- Making the tester work for the bonus
- In the meantime you can look at my `test_main.c` file to see what you can do with it
- This tester **DOES NOT** guarantee a full pass, small reminder that testing things yourself is always better...
- **OR** If you are feeling particularly fancy you can play around with it and make a pull request 🤔
- Updates coming soon**TM**

### I'm really lazy and just want an answer to copy paste
